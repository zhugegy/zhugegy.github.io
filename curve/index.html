  Do you know that human brain can store as much as 1,000 terabytes (TB) of information? This simple tool is an attempt to utilize our gifted fortune - our brain power as much as possible, to learn as effectively and efficiently as possible.

  Below are some videos explaining the underlying learning concept - spaced repetition, to which this tool tries to provide aids.

  <li>How do the Internet and mobile devices affect our learning capacity without our awareness?</li>
  <li>How to rescue our concentrate ability and memorize ability that have been consistently and brutally suppressed by the information era?</li>
  <li>How shall we adapt our reading habits from physical to digital in a reasonable manner without compromise?</li>
  <li>How to proactively take advantage of the technologies to benefit our learning, rather than mindlessly become manipulated by them?</li>

  These are questions worth thinking.
